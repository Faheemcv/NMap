Lab - SMB Login Enumeration
------------------------------------
SMB (Server Message Block) is the protocol Windows uses for file and printer sharing — ports 445/tcp and sometimes 139/tcp.

Login enumeration means:
Checking which SMB accounts exist or are valid, often by analyzing the server’s responses to authentication or info queries.

This helps network defenders and ethical pentesters find:

Misconfigured shares (like “Everyone” access)
Anonymous or guest access
Usernames exposed through SMB responses
Weak or default configurations

Why It Matters

Attackers may try to enumerate SMB logins to prepare brute-force or password-spray attacks.
Admins can test for this exposure to harden systems and prevent information leakage.
During vulnerability assessments, SMB enumeration often reveals domain users, OS info, shares, and permissions.
