Using Verbosity in Nmap Output
--------------------------------
Using Verbosity in Nmap Output (-v and -vv)

Verbosity in Nmap controls how much detail Nmap displays during and after a scan.
It’s extremely helpful for understanding scan progress, why results appear a certain way, and debugging network issues.

Purpose of Verbosity

By default, Nmap keeps its output concise.
Adding verbosity (-v) increases the level of information shown about:
Scan progress
Host discovery
Port states
Service detection
OS detection and reasoning
You can add multiple v characters (e.g., -vv, -vvv) to increase the level of detail.

| nmap -v <target> |
| nmap -vv <target> |
| nmap -sS -sV -O -v <target> |
