Spoofing IP Addresses
---------------------------------

What Is IP Spoofing?
IP spoofing is the technique of faking the source IP address in a packet so that it appears to come from a different machine.

Why Do Hackers Use IP Spoofing?
 1. To Hide Their Identity

Attackers spoof IPs so logs do not show their real machine.
 2. To Bypass IP-Based Security

Some systems allow traffic only from trusted IPs.
