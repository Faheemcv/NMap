What is the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)?
-------------------------------------------
The Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is a framework within Nmap that uses scripts written in Lua to extend Nmap’s functionality beyond basic port scanning.

NSE is used to:

Detect vulnerabilities in applications or systems.
Perform network discovery (find hosts, open ports, and services).
Enumerate users, shares, and configurations.
Brute-force credentials (where legal).
Perform version and OS detection enhancements.
Automate custom scanning logic via scripts.
