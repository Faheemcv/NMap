Using Decoys to Evade Detection
------------------------------------------
Using decoys in Nmap is a stealth technique that helps hide your real IP address during a scan. It makes the scan appear to come from multiple IP addresses, confusing firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and log analysis tools.

What Is a Decoy Scan?

A decoy scan sends packets to the target using multiple fake IP addresses along with your real IP.
The target sees traffic coming from many IPs, so it’s difficult to tell which IP is the real attacker.

How to Use Decoys in Nmap
The decoy option is:

| -D <decoy1,decoy2,ME,decoy3> |
| $ sudo nmap -sS -p80 -D 45.45.45.45,100.100.100.100,192.168.1.103 -e en0 scanme.nmap.org |

Why Use Decoy Scans? (Advantages)
 1. Hide Your Real IP
The target sees multiple source IPs → hard to identify the true scanner.
 2. Confuse Intrusion Detection Systems
Security analysts will struggle to trace the real attacker.
 3. Bypass IP-based Blocking
If the target bans IPs that scan it, you avoid detection or blocking.
