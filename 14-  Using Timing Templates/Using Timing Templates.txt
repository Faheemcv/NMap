Section 7 :                    SCAN TIMING AND PERFORMANCE
------------------------------------------------------------

 Using Timing Templates
-------------------------
- Scans will be faster when we use timing templates
Timing templates in Nmap control how fast or slow your scan runs — balancing speed, accuracy, and stealth.

Purpose of Timing Templates

Different networks and environments require different scanning speeds:
Slow scans are stealthy and less likely to trigger firewalls or intrusion detection systems (IDS).
Fast scans finish quickly but can overwhelm networks or be easily detected.
Timing templates give you quick presets so you don’t have to fine-tune dozens of individual timing options.

Command Syntax
| nmap -T<0-5> <target> |

| $sudo nmap scanme.nmap.org -T5 |

The Six Timing Templates
Template	Name	Description
-T0	Paranoid	Slowest. Used for IDS evasion — sends one probe every 5 minutes.
-T1	Sneaky	Very slow, stealthy scanning.
-T2	Polite	Slower than default; reduces network load.
-T3	Normal (Default)	Balanced speed and reliability.
-T4	Aggressive	Faster scans for reliable networks; may trigger IDS/firewalls.
-T5	Insane	Extremely fast — for local networks only. High risk of dropped packets.
