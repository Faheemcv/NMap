 Lab - Scanning for TLS Certificates and Versions
----------------------------------------------------

1. What Is TLS Certificate & Version Scanning?

TLS scanning helps you identify:

✔ TLS/SSL version
(SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0/1.1/1.2/1.3)

✔ Certificate details
Common Name (CN)
SAN domains
Issuer (CA)
Expiration date
Key size (1024/2048 bits)
Signature algorithm (SHA1/SHA256)
Weak or expired certificates

✔ Weak configurations
Deprecated versions (SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS1.0)
Weak ciphers (RC4, DES, EXPORT-grade)
