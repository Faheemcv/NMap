 Lab - NSE Vulnerability Scripts
------------------------------------------------------

What Are NSE Vulnerability Scripts?

NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) includes a special category of scripts called vuln scripts.
These scripts test targets for known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and security weaknesses.

They automate checks such as:

Outdated software versions
Default or weak configurations
Common CVEs (e.g., SMB, HTTP, FTP vulnerabilities)
Missing patches

They are safe for scanning in your lab or on systems you’re authorized to test — but must not be used on unknown/public systems.
How Nmap Vulnerability Scripts Work
They run against specific open ports
Check banners, protocol responses, or exploitation vectors
Detect if the target is vulnerable
Output “VULNERABLE”, “LIKELY VULNERABLE”, or “NOT VULNERABLE”
They do NOT exploit the system — they only test safely.
