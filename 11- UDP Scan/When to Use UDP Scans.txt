When to Use UDP Scans
---------------------------
UDP scans (-sU) are used when you need to discover UDP-based services or understand how UDP traffic is treated by hosts/firewalls. UDP is very different from TCP: many services speak UDP (DNS, SNMP, NTP, etc.), UDP is connectionless, and responses (or lack of them) are interpreted differently. Use a UDP scan when any of the following apply.

When to run a UDP scan — practical situations
You need to find UDP services (DNS, NTP, SNMP, TFTP, DHCP, NetBIOS, RIP, SSDP, IPSec/IKE).
Performing a full inventory of a host/subnet — include UDP to avoid blindspots.
Security testing / vulnerability assessment — many vulnerabilities are on UDP services (SNMP misconfigs, open DNS resolvers, etc.).
Troubleshooting UDP connectivity — determine whether UDP probes are dropped by a firewall.
Firewall / filtering analysis — UDP behavior often shows “open|filtered” vs. ICMP port unreachable (closed), revealing filter policies.
