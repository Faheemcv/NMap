NMap
__________
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source tool used for network scanning and security auditing. It helps network administrators and cybersecurity professionals discover devices on a network, find open ports, detect services running on those ports, and check for vulnerabilities.

-|What Can Nmap Do?
  Scan networks to detect connected hosts and their IP addresses.
  Find open ports on a device (like port 80 for HTTP, 22 for SSH, etc.).
  Identify services and versions running on those ports.
  Detect operating systems (OS detection).
  Check for security vulnerabilities.
  Perform network security audits.

-|Common Use Cases
  Penetration testing
  Network inventory
  Firewall testing
  Monitoring host or service uptime

capturing Nmap scans with wireshark
-------------------------------------
- open the wireshark double click ethernet0  
- open kalilinux terminal emulator use the command line
  | $sudo nmap -sS -p 80,443 webscantest.com |
- in wireshark  we can see the packet captured through the cable ethernet0. when scan is run

LAB- FIRST NMAP SCAN
-------------------------
| $nmap scanme.nmap.org |

This runs a basic default Nmap scan on the host scanme.nmap.org, which is a public test server provided by the Nmap developers themselves.
- nmap → launches the Nmap network scanning tool.
- scanme.nmap.org → is the target domain (owned by Nmap for safe testing).

-|Purpose of This Command
Practice: It’s meant for beginners and learners to safely test Nmap without breaking any rules.
Demonstration: To understand how scanning works, and what typical Nmap output looks like.
Testing installations: To confirm that Nmap is installed and working properly on your system.

12. How to Scan a Host, Subnet, or IP Range
--------------------------------------------
-| $ifconfig |:-
  ifconfig is a classic Unix/Linux command that shows and configures network interfaces. On Kali (and most Linux distros) you can use it to    view IP addresses, MACs, interface status, and bring interfaces up/down.

- to scan a domain | $nmap scanme.nmap.org |
- to scan a ip address | $nmap 192.168.4.1 |
- | $nmap 192.168.4.0/24 | to scan a host
- | $nmap 192.168.1.0/24 192.168.4.0/24 | to scan a tow subnet or multiple subnet scanning
- | $nmap 192.168.4.0-10 | to scan a range address in a subnet
