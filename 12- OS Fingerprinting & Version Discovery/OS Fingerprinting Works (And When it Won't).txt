 How OS Fingerprinting Works (And When it Won't)
-------------------------------------------------
OS fingerprinting is the process of determining the operating system (and often kernel version) running on a remote host by observing how that host implements parts of the TCP/IP stack. Tools (like Nmap, p0f, Xprobe) send carefully crafted probes (or just observe traffic) and compare the responses to a database of known behaviours. Because every OS (and sometimes particular kernel/build) implements low-level networking slightly differently, those differences form a “fingerprint.”

| $ sudo nmap -O 192.168.1.1 -v |
Short answer: this runs an active OS detection scan (-O) against 192.168.1.1 with increased verbosity (-v) and uses sudo so Nmap can send raw packets (needed for accurate fingerprinting). Below is a practical walkthrough of what each part does, what Nmap will try to learn, example output snippets, how to read them, and tips to improve accuracy.

Flags explained

sudo — run with root privileges (required for raw packet sends/receives used by -O and some scan types).
nmap — the scanner.
-O — Active OS detection. Nmap sends several specially crafted probes and compares responses to its OS fingerprint database.
192.168.1.1 — the target IP (commonly a gateway/router on home/office LANs).
-v — verbose mode; Nmap prints more progress information and intermediate details.
