What is Version Discovery?
-------------------------------
                                                              
Version discovery (also called service version detection) is an Nmap feature used to identify the exact software and version running on open ports — not just the port number or service name.
It’s activated using the -sV option and is one of the most powerful parts of Nmap’s scanning capabilities.

| sudo nmap -sV 192.168.1.1 |
| sudo nmap -sV scanme.nmap.org |
| sudo nmap -sS -sV 192.168.1.10 |

Purpose

When Nmap detects an open port (e.g., port 80 = HTTP), it doesn’t automatically know:
Which web server is running (Apache, Nginx, IIS, etc.),
What version it is (e.g., Apache 2.4.54), or
What protocol variant is used (e.g., HTTPS vs HTTP).

That’s where version discovery comes in — it probes the service with carefully chosen requests to elicit identifiable responses and compare them against Nmap’s built-in service fingerprint database.
