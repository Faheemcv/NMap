16. Lab - Ping and Top Ports Scans
--------------------------------------
1.| $sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.1 |
  What sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.1 does
  Short version: it checks whether the host 192.168.1.1 is up (reachable). It does host discovery only — no port scanning.

  sudo — runs Nmap with root privileges (allows raw packets and useful probes such as ARP).
  nmap — the program.
  -sn — ping scan / host discovery only. Nmap will not scan ports; it only tries to determine whether the target is alive.
  192.168.1.1 — target IP (single host).

2.| $ sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 |
  Nice — sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 is a very common and useful command. Here’s exactly what it does, what to expect, and a few handy   variants.

  sudo — runs Nmap with root privileges (allows ARP/raw packets).
  nmap — the tool.
  -sn — ping scan / host discovery only (no port scans).
  192.168.1.0/24 — target subnet (all addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255).
 
  Result: Nmap will probe each IP in that /24 to determine which hosts are “up” (alive). On a local Ethernet/bridged VM it will prefer ARP   requests (very reliable), and also send ICMP or TCP probes as needed.

3.| $ nmap --top-ports 20 192.168.1.1 |
 :- nmap — run Nmap.
 :- --top-ports 20 — scan the 20 most common ports according to Nmap’s internal ranked list (instead of the default top 1000 or specifying  ports manually).
 :- 192.168.1.1 — the single target IP.
  So Nmap will probe the 20 ports it considers most likely to be open on that host and report which are open/closed/filtered and the service   name it recognizes (e.g., http, ssh).

. Lab - OS Fingerprinting and Aggressive Scanning
---------------------------------------------------

4.| $ nmap -O 192.168.1.1 |
  Short answer: -O tells Nmap to perform OS detection (TCP/IP stack fingerprinting) against the target 192.168.1.1. Nmap will try to identify the operating system and sometimes the device type (router, printer, Linux, Windows, etc.).
nmap — the tool.
-O — enable OS detection. Nmap sends a series of carefully crafted probes and examines subtle differences in the TCP/IP responses to match them against its OS fingerprint database.
192.168.1.1 — target IP.

5.| $ sudo nmap -A 192.168.1.1 |
  Nice — sudo nmap -A 192.168.1.1 is one of the most commonly used one-liners for a thorough, quick reconnaissance of a host. Here’s a clear breakdown of what it does, what to expect, and important cautions.
  What -A does
  -A enables "aggressive" mode — a bundle of advanced checks:
  OS detection (-O) — fingerprint the target’s operating system.
  Version detection (-sV) — probe open ports to identify service names and versions.
  Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) (--script=default) — run default NSE scripts (e.g., banner grabs, basic vulnerability/info scripts).
  Traceroute — map the path packets take to the target.
  So the command runs host discovery (if needed), scans ports, then performs OS/service detection, runs scripts, and does traceroute.


6. | $sudo nmap -sS -p 80 scanme.nmap.org |
  Nice — that’s a common Nmap command. Here’s a clear breakdown of what it does, what you’ll see, and safe/ethical notes.
$ sudo nmap -sS -p 80 scanme.nmap.org

sudo — runs nmap with root privileges (required for some low-level scan types so raw packets can be sent).

nmap — the network mapper program.

-sS — SYN scan (a “half-open” TCP scan). Nmap sends a TCP SYN; if the target replies with SYN/ACK the port is considered open (Nmap then sends RST to avoid completing the full TCP handshake). Fast and stealthier than a full connect scan.

-p 80 — scan only TCP port 80 (HTTP).

scanme.nmap.org — the target hostname. (This host is intentionally provided by the Nmap project for testing — it’s allowed to scan. Do not scan systems you don’t have permission for.)
